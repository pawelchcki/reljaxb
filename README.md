reljaxb
=======

Simple relational helpers for Jaxb. 
It's part of old college project,

recently dusted off to fix old screwups.

I wrote it 4+ years ago on commute bus using 10" EeePC :D

It sux in many ways, so to make it less sucky I should:
- remove some junk classes from timetable project
- normalize package names
- fix couple 'algorithms' which IIRC are really sucky
- improve README


note:
I haven't really used java since those 4+ years so be gentle :p
